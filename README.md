# Life on MARS!
WorldGen - Interactive game where actions on environment affects user game!

We are using standard java libraries for the 2D completed product, and using oculus and unity3D for the VR demo.

No prior coding or planning was done;  we actually assembled at the hackathon!


## Development

Life on MARS (WorldGen) was developed at **SodaHacks** by Minh Nguyen, MyeongJae *"Tommy"* Chu, Richard Yu, and Luke Vacek in 30 hours.
